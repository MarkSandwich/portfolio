My name is Mark Sanchez and I am pursuing a career in Computer Science. I completed a course at Clovis Community with Dr. Alcazar and others to learn about the tools used in genomic biology. While my interests do not align with the field of biology, I did come to appreciate learning the basics of the programming language R.
